      <h1 id="wtm">WebTaskManager</h1>
      <p>
        WebTaskManager is a simple task manager that runs in a web browser. It
        is designed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend and no
        ready-made tools or additional libraries are used, all codes are written
        by hand. On the server side, C, C++ and a C library libhttp are used. No
        additional download is required. Library external files and their
        details are as in the table below. Tested in Chrome and Firefox browsers
        on virtual machines with 2 and 4 CPUs.
      </p>

      </center>
      <p>
        The files in the data_files folder are used to exchange data between the
        frontend and the backend.
      </p>
      <h1 id="getting-started">Getting started</h1>
      <p>
        To start the application, it is sufficient to type
        <strong>"make"</strong> on the command line. Press enter twice or use
        the ctrl+c shortcut to close the program.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program consists of 4 main sections, System info, Command Block,
        Settings and Logs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The System info section shows us the load average for the last 1 minute,
        the loads (%) of all CPUs and the System uptime. This section also
        contains buttons for restarting, shutting down, and canceling these
        operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the second part for the whole process management. In this section,
        there is an input where we enter the commands to start the terminal, and
        an input where we can terminate these processes according to the name or
        process id. In addition, there is a table that contains the information
        of the processes we run and allows us to perform a few operations on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The remaining two sections allow us to make minor adjustments to the
        page and see the logs created by the application.
      </p>
      <img src="./content/sections.png" alt="sections" />

      <h1 id="system-info">System Info</h1>
      <h2 id="loadavg">Load Average</h2>
      <p>
        Load Average data is read from the /proc/loadavg file ( server.c 168-182
        ) and saved in the loadavg.json file in json data format with the
        incoming server request. Then the frontend reads this data and displays
        it on the screen ( app.js 183-195 ).
      </p>
      <h2 id="cpu-load">CPU Load</h2>
      <p>
        I used an algorithm to calculate the processing load of the cores.
        First, I pulled data from the /proc/stat file. This file contains some
        CPU related data, We need the data after the first line ( server.c
        108-136).
      </p>
      <img class="img2" src="./content/procstat.png" alt="proc-stat" />
      <p>
        Data is then arranged by string operations and listed in an array to
        perform calculations. The meanings of these data;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1st column : <strong>user</strong> = normal processes executing in
          user mode
        </li>
        <li>
          2nd column : <strong>nice</strong> = niced processes executing in user
          mode
        </li>
        <li>
          3rd column : <strong>system</strong> = processes executing in kernel
          mode
        </li>
        <li>4th column : <strong>idle</strong> = twiddling thumbs</li>
        <li>
          5th column : <strong>iowait</strong> = waiting for I/O to complete
        </li>
        <li>6th column : <strong>irq</strong> = servicing interrupts</li>
        <li>7th column : <strong>softirq</strong> = servicing softirqs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For the calculation, the following calculation is used in the double
        data type ( server.c 149-166):
      </p>
      <p>u = user + system</p>
      <p>t = user + system + idle</p>
      <p>
        Then it is waited for 1 second and the changes in these data are
        measured.
      </p>
      <p>(u1-u0) * 100 / (t1- t0)</p>
      <p>The resulting data shows the CPU load.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Control testing of this data was done with gnome-system-monitor and
          the resulting data is equal.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        This operation is done for each CPU and stored in the load.json file as
        a json array, the first element of this array is the number of
        processors received with the <strong>“nproc”</strong> command. The
        response to the incoming ajax http request is refreshed and read by the
        frontend and displayed on the screen ( app.js 98-123 ).
      </p>
      <h3>
        Why did I choose to wait 1 second at the beginning of this calculation?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Because the server runs on our device, it uses our system's resources.
        This means sending a lot of server requests for a lot of data refreshed
        on the screen along with CPU Load. As a result of this situation, it
        shows a higher value than it should be because the CPU usage increases
        instantly. That's why I thought it appropriate to wait a second at the
        beginning.
      </p>
      <h2 id="sb">System Buttons</h2>
      <p>
        Reboot ( server.c 299-308 ), Shutdown ( server.c 308-318 buttons send a
        request and these requests trigger the commands between the lines
        specified.
      </p>
      <img class="img3" src="./content/query.png" alt="query" />
      <p>
        If this field is left blank, the transaction will take place
        immediately, if the data is entered, the transaction will take place
        after the entered minute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cancel ( server.c 318-321 ) button triggers the "shutdown -c" command.
      </p>
      <h1 id="command-block">Command Block Section</h1>
      <h2 id="run">Run command</h2>
      <p>
        Submitting this form sends a request to the server and sends the input
        value as a parameter. The server.c file decodes this parameter, passes
        it to the runCommand file and executes it ( server.c 321-331 ). At the
        same time, the ID of the running process is sent to the pinfo.txt file
        before it runs to the runCommand file. ”runCommand” reads this info and
        executes some functions to get name of command, load of process and
        allowed CPUs of it. This is the first step in creating the table. This
        data is compiled and written to the processinfo.json file in JSON format
        ( runCommand.c 92-100 ). With this first data, the table row is
        generated and displayed on the screen ( app.js 284-332 ).
      </p>
      <h2 id="kill">Kill Command</h2>
      <p>
        The process of terminating a transaction is quite simple. First, when
        the form is submitted, it is checked whether the value is a number and
        accordingly a different ajax http request is sent ( app.js 153-206 ).
        The backend uses the pkill method if it receives a kill request by name,
        otherwise it uses some c functions ( server.c 331-339 ).
      </p>
      <p class="hint">
        Hint: You can have it automatically forwarded to the kill command form
        by double-clicking the ID of a process in the table.
      </p>
      <img src="./content/double-click.png" alt="double-click" />
      <h2 id="update">Update of the table</h2>
      <p>
        Modern browsers provide us with
        <strong>Local Storage and Session Storage</strong>
        features that we can use as a local database, data in Local Storage is
        kept until the browser history is deleted, and data in Session Storage
        is kept until the browser is closed. That's why I used Session Storage
        quite a few times in this project.
      </p>
      <img src="./content/local-database.png" alt="local-database" />
      <p>
        In order not to lose the input value when the page is refreshed in the
        run command, kill command sections, logs and settings section, I saved
        it in the local database.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the refresh page setting is active in the settings section, the CPU
        load, Load average, uptime, logs and table part are updated in the
        selected period. And required data is fetched from local database. But
        this phase needs some additional backend progress. First of all, the
        transaction ID is sent as a parameter with the request. This id is
        handled in updateProcess and goes through almost the same stages as
        runCommand. Then, by pulling the resulting data from the
        updatedinfo.json file, it is updated in the table array in Session
        Storage. It is displayed on the screen when the page is refreshed.
      </p>
      <h3>How do runCommand and updateProcess files get the required data?</h3>
      <p>
        The file "/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/comm" is read to get the name of the
        command. For the CPU usage of the process, the command "top -b -n 2 -d 1
        -p %d | tail -1 | awk '{print $9}' > "./data_files/load.txt" is executed
        and then the value In order to see the CPU actively used by the process,
        the "ps -o psr -p &lt;pid&gt; > ./data_files/psr.txt" command is
        executed and data is drawn from the required file, and the same
        processes also list the CPU that the process has permission to use. This
        time the command "taskset -pc &lt;pid&gt; >
        ./data_files/allowedcpus.txt" is used.
      </p>
      <h3>How to change CPU load and active CPU?</h3>
      <p>
        To limit the CPU usage of a process, it is sufficient to enter a value
        between 0 and 100 in the required input in the table and press enter.
        Then a request is sent to the server and the limitCPULoad file is run (
        server.c 375-393 ).
      </p>
      <p>
        This file converts the scheduling policy of the process to
        sched_deadline and provides the restriction with a few additional steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        A similar process above is used to change the active CPU. After you send
        the data, this request is processed in the Backend and first the
        scheduling policy is updated with sched_other with the command "sudo
        chrt -o -p 0 &lt;pid&gt;". Then the command "taskset -pc
        &lt;affinity&gt; &lt;pid&gt;" is executed and the process is completed (
        server.c 349-375 ).
      </p>
      <p class="hint">
        Hint: When executing these operations for the first time, do not forget
        to enter the password to grant root permission from the terminal screen.
